Some notes and reference information found about common acids I used when creating this mod:

Acetic acid (HC2H3O2)  is found in vinegar as well as products that contain vinegar, such as ketchup
Citric acid (H3C6H5O7) is found in citrus fruits. It is also used in jams and jellies and to add a tangy 
                       flavor to other foods
Lactic acid (C3H6O3)   is found in milk and other dairy products
Ascorbic acid (C6H8O6) is vitamin C. It is found in citrus fruits as well as some other fruits and juices
Sulfuric acid (H2SO4)  is found in car batteries and some drain cleaners

In unmodded 7 Days to Die, we have:

acetic acid:
    beer (poor-grade grain alcholic) -- feeding oxygen to a grain alcohol can yield vinegar
    grain alcohol (good-grade grain alcholic) -- feeding oxygen to a grain alcohol can yield vinegar

citric acid:
    blueberry (high)
    snowberry (high)
    can of pears (moderate)
    coffee beans (moderate)
    pumpkin (very low)

lactic acid:
    coffee beans (low)

ascorbic acid:
    none

sufuric acid:
    acid (from sinks, cars, etc., implying it's used as a cleaning and automotive agent: this is ALREADY
        the acid we want)
    coal (burning coal yields sulfur dioxide, a gas -- when combined with water makes sulfurous acid
        but NOT sulfuric acid, which requires a catalyst such as nitric acid)

other acids:
    aloe vera leaf (small amounts of salicylic acid, amino acids, etc.)
    jar of honey (moderate amount of gloconic acid)
    coffee beans (chlorogenic, quinic, citric, acetic, lactic, malic, phosphoric, linoleic, and palmitic)
    nitrate powder (adding another acid as a catalyst, we can extract nitric acid)

This therefore leaves us essentially three pathways to making acid:

    (1) creating vinegar from alcohol and concentrating the solution

    (2) extracting and refining various acids from plants

    (3) introducing an acid as a catalyst to process nitric acid from nitrate powder and using that
        with sulfur dioxide we could get from burning coal

Ideally, sulfuric acid is the preferred acid to use when producing batteries, however collecting a
toxic gas seems dangerous and difficult to do in the wasteland to process coal and nitrate powder
into sulfuric acid (and the entire process actually requires some acid as a catalyst anyway).  This
mod will not be exploring acid production by this method.  It would not be impossible to do, but is
not the easiest way to obtain acid in the wasteland (my opinion).

Additionally, separating citric acid from plants also requires an acid catalyst and since it is not
suitable as an acid for use as an industrial catalyst, this mod will not be exploring acid production
by this method either.

Therefore, this mod will only focus on this somewhat realistic game path to concentrating acetic acid
from vinegar that has developed from grain alcohol.  Acetic acid is not usually preferable for
manufacturing batteries (known to leak), but the process is feasible and the acid does work well as
a cleaning agent and for other general uses 7 Days to Die has for acid.

Here's the process:

    (1) starting with grain alcohol, we introduce oxygen and bottle it in a dark, warm environment

    (2) after 3 weeks to 6 months, bacteria will cloud the liquid and form a congealed layer on or
        near the top of the alcohol (this is mother of vinegar)

    (3) after another 4 weeks, the contents should now be vinegar (with mother floating in it)

    (4) the vinegar should be filtered through a coffee filter or cheesecloth and the mother kept

    (5) fractional-freeze the vinegar (discard vinegar liquid, keep acid solids) until it's a high
        concentration of acetic acid

Given this process, the mod will add the following:

[item]    cloudy alcohol
[item]    roiled alcohol
[item]    vinegar (unfiltered)
[item]    vinegar mother
[item]    vinegar (filtered)
[item]    frozen vinegar
[item]    weak acid
[item]    frozen weak acid
[item]    strong acid
[recipe]  1x grain alcohol => cloudy alcohol
[recipe]  * 1x cloudy alcohol => roiled alcohol [skip with mother]
[recipe]  * 1x roiled alcohol => unfiltered vinegar [skip with mother]
[recipe]  ** 1x vinegar mother + 1x grain alcohol => unfiltered vinegar
[recipe]  *** 1x unfiltered vinegar => vinegar mother & vinegar
[recipe]  1x vinegar => frozen vinegar
[recipe]  1x frozen vinegar => weak acid
[recipe]  1x weak acid => frozen weak acid
[recipe]  1x frozen weak acid => strong acid
[recipe]  3x strong acid => acid
[progression]  learn vinegars from 'Master Chef' rank 3
[progression]  learn acids from 'Physician' rank 2
[loot]    one recipe that teaches the player all of the vinegars
[loot]    one recipe that teaches the player all of the acids

*   Note: this part of the process can be skipped by keeping and re-using the organic vinegar
          mother for the next batch, vastly accellerating the process.

**  Note: re-using the vinegar mother in the next batch skips over waiting for it to develop
          naturally, saving lots of time on subsequent batches.

*** Note: this isn't actually a recipe, since crafting can't yield 2 items.  Instead, you [Open]
          the item from your inventory (or use it from your hotkey bar) to unpack ('filter') it.
